NPMPublishPlugin allows you to integrate an NPM package into your Publish site. If you require javascript or css to be built for your site, this is the ideal plugin for you.

#### [PackageDSL](https://github.com/brightdigit/PackageDSL)

**macOS** | **linux** | **iOS** | **watchOS** | **tvOS**

Simplify the management of your Package.swift file with PackageDSL. I was having a difficult time managing a large Package.swift file. PackageDSL allows you to setup individual targets, products, and dependencies using this DSL and create an easily organized, simplified, and easy to maintain Package for your Swift project.

#### [SimulatorServices](https://github.com/brightdigit/SimulatorServices)

**macOS**

SimulatorServices provides an easy to use API for managing, querying, and accessing simulators on your Mac.

SimulatorServices allows you to execute subcommands to simctl directly in Swift while offering an easy to use API for parsing and passing arguments.

SimulatorServices uses the SimCtl object to pass subcommands. Each subcommand objects takes custom arguments or property and can parse the standard output into an easy to use Swift object. There are currently two supported subcommands: GetAppContainers and List.

**macOS** | **iOS** | **watchOS** | **tvOS** | **linux**

Share your local development server easily with your Apple devices.

When you are developing a full stack Swift application, you want to easily test and debug your application on both the device (iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, etc...) as well as your development server. If you are using simulator then setting your host server to localhost will work but often we need to test on an actual device. You can either be an IT expert your local network's DNS or you can use Sublimation to easily connect your local server to your device.

#### [SundialKit](https://github.com/brightdigit/SundialKit)

**iOS** | **watchOS**

Reactive communications library across Apple platforms.

For easier use in reactive user interfaces, especially with SwiftUI and Combine, I've created a library which abstracts and maps common connectivity APIs. Particularly in my app Heartwitch, I mapped the functionality of WatchConnectivity and Network over to track the user's ability to connect to the Internet as well as the ability for their iPhone to connect to their Apple Watch via WatchConnectivity

#### [SyndiKit](https://github.com/brightdigit/SyndiKit)

**macOS** | **iOS** | **watchOS** | **tvOS** | **linux**

Built on top of XMLCoder, SyndiKit can be used to import and read site data whether from a WordPress site, RSS feeds, YouTube channel or podcast.

ThirtyTo provides a way to encode data and create identifiers which is both efficient and human-readable. While Base64 is more efficient it is not very human-readable with both both upper case and lower case letters as well as punctuation.

Base32Crockford offers the most reasonable compromise when it comes to encoding data. Being a super set of Base16, it uses all ten digits and 22 of the 26 Latin upper case characters.
